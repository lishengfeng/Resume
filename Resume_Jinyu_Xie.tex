      \begin{itemize}
      \item NSF Funded Project with 3 journals and 3 conference proceedings:
        Modeling, Identification, and Control towards Adaptive Personalized Glucose
        Management for Insulin-Deficient Diabetes.
        
      \item Designed data collection experiment protocols that are both
        clinically practical and highly excited for system identification.

      \item Proposed a nonlinear data-driven model with multiple physiological
        inputs to capture the blood sugar dynamics of the diabetic patients.
        Validated the model with large scale of time-series data (3-day-length
        data from 30 virtual patients and 5 real patients). 
        
      \item Applied signal processing algorithms (Extended Kalman Filter, FIR
        Filter) and time series analysis (ARMAX) and for data preprocessing, model
        parameter estimation and state estimation. Predicted the blood sugar level in 30
        minutes with accuracy as high as 85\% in terms of FIT values.

      \item Developed an Adaptive Model Predictive Controller that can
        ``intelligently learn'' the model of the patient in real time and deliver
        personalized therapy regimen.
        
      \item Introduced an innovative adaptive filtering algorithm (Variable
        State Dimension Filter) to detect and estimate the meals taken by
        patients with a successful detection rate of 96\% and false alarm rate
        of 8\%.

      \begin{itemize}
      \item Delivered an enhanced pipeline leak detection system together with
        technical reports ready for commission and deployment in time and
        quality.
        
      \item Highlighted intern project by a General Manager at Shell US PhD
        Intern Symposium. Received a prestigious award nominated by Process
        Automation Control \& Optimization Group. 
        
      \item Worked in a project team (3 people across 2 different functionality
        groups). Weekly meet up for brain storming and task distribution. Biweekly
        report to project managers and line managers. Exposure to risk management,
        algorithm prototyping (using Matlab) and hands-on implementation (using PI
        Processbook and Shell Production Universe).
        
      \item Enhanced the existing pipeline leak monitor system (only detect
        oil leakage in steady-state flow) to detect leakage during noisy
        transient states by introducing model-based fault detection
        methodologies. The enhanced monitor system covers the full operation time
        (100\%) compared with 60\% of time with the original monitor system.  
        
      \item Identified the bias of the existing estimation algorithm by going
        through 2 years of plant data, and presented a compensation strategy that
        achieved 5\% improvement of estimation accuracy.
        
      \item Sped up the system deployment and replication procedure by modifying the system
        structures and eliminating redundant codes (Visual Basic).
        
      \item Prepared simulation demo videos for operator education purposes.

      logistic regression, k-nearest-neighbor, CART) and clustering (k-means,
      k-center, mixture Gaussian) algorithms in Matlab for
      supervised/unsupervised learning.
    \item Performed k-fold cross validation to evaluate the prediction
      performance of each learning algorithm.
